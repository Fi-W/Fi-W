- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fi-W
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things to empower myself. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI related models and coding, including machine learning, computer vision & NLP, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on areas that need AI usage. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Any questions or interests, please email me @ yutingwang668@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Happy learning, improving everyday, and constantly challenging myself!
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  I actually graduated from an Arts area, earned a master degree in Education and spent almost the last ten years in education industry with no access to coding at all.
  I literally started this from scratch but I like the challenge and have managed some parts so far, as can be shown from MyDemo.
  I'm not afraid of changes, willing to take up challenges and firmly believe that it's never too late to learn and pursue my dreams.
